	  		<h1>History</h1>
	  		<h3>
	  			Headquartered in Evanston, IL, Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded on March 9th, 1856 at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa.  It's founders were Noble Leslie Devotie, Nathan Elams Cockrell, John Barret Rudolph, John Webb Kerr, Samuel Marion Dennis, Wade Hampton Foster, Abner EdwinPatton, and Thomas Chappell Cook. Under the direction of Devotie, the ritual, secret hand grip, and the name was created. Today, over 307,000 brothers have been initiated into our realm. With over 228 chapters nation wide, there is roughly 14,000 current undergraduate brothers with over 190,000 living alumni as well. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is the biggest fraternity currently in the nation.
	  		</h3>
	  		<h3>
	  			The Pennsylvania Tau Gamma Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon began in the early fall of 2002 with the determination of one young man. Greg Brunner rounded up close to 40 gentlemen in the basement of Killinger Hall and began drafting what would be the original by-laws of the 10th fraternity at West Chester University. Greg Brunner, Brad Sorrells, and Matt Barraveccio were named president, vice president, and treasurer, respectively. The founding fathers yearned for a strong commitment to civility, loyalty, scholarship, and brotherhood and swore to not succumb to the pitfalls of other Greek Organizations.
			</h3> 

			<h3>
				Pennsylvania Tau Gamma grew in popularity very quickly; they initiated the inaugural Alpha pledge class, consisting of 13 men, in Spring of 2003. The men of SAE continue striving to be academic, athletic, and respected role models at West Chester University. In April of 2004, the Pennsylvania Tau Gamma received their charter from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Nationals and became the newest chapter at West Chester University. Subsequently, they were awarded the Greek Cup on campus in 2004 and Greg Brunner was named President of the Year. Currently, the Pennsylvania Tau Gamma has 17 initiated pledge classes, and is recruiting a rapidly growing pool of potential members.
